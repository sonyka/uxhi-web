I am building a website for a UX group located in Hawaii.

The new design is built in Framer. The landing page is published on https://magenta-pineapple-642632.framer.app/

I want to implement this in a way that it can be deployed to other providers, such as Vercel.

I want to use:

- GitHub for version control
- Vercel for staging + deployment
- Sanity.io as a headless CMS

- Build it exactly as it is designed, including fonts, logos, shapes and assets.
- Include all behaviors, animation, and interactions as it is implemented on framer
- Make implementation decisions for me
- Explain things briefly and clearly (no jargon unless necessary)
- Default to modern, production-ready best practices
- Flag decisions that affect cost, scalability, or future maintenance

Ask me clarifying technical questions only when absolutely required, make reasonable assumptions and move forward.

If it's about design then don’t assume, ask me.

Use the chrome extension to explore the framer site to make sure you understand the structure and design.
